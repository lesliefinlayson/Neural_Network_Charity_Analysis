# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Purpose
Create a binary classification model that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results

### _Data Preprocessing_

Model's target variable: "Is Successful"

Model's features variables: "Status", "Asking Amount", "Application Type", "Income Amount", "Classification", "Special Considerations"

Variables that are neither targets nor features, and therefore removed:  "EIN", "Name", "Affiliation", "Use_Case", "Organization"

### _Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model_

Number of neurons, layers, and activation functions selected for this neural network model, and why:

In researching the question of how many neurons, how many layers, etc, the answer that kept appearing is that there is no "right" way to go about this, that it is trial and error.  I therefore started with numbers in Canvas's example.  

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

No, my first attempt fell short:

What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
